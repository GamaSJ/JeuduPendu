Hello!

For you to play the game you have to do the following:

a) Create a txt file with words (one per line, all in lower case).
   An example of such file is available under the name "mots_pendu.txt". You can use it directly to run the game.
   If desired, you can create your own list of words to play.
   
   
b) Make sure to save the aforementioned .txt file in the same directory as the code.
   The code will ask you for the name of the txt file.
   
   
   
C) Download the code & Run the Game!
   NOTE: By default, the user/player have 6 attemps.
   If desired, you can change such value inside the function "gameplay", look for variable "attemps_left"
   
   
D) Have fun while playing!
